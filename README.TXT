This was the Project I made for my Diploma. It is the first thing I have ever coded. When I made this I was only coding for a year, so it is not perfect but it is my baby. 

The heart of this website is the order process of the Boxes because you will have to answer a few questions before you can recieve the box that is perfect for you. I made all the graphics on my own.

To run it you need to:

- Insert DB dump
- Configuerade config.php and apps.php
- Set url in public/js/main.js

The default admin account is:

admin@admin.at
Admin123

You can access the admin interface with backend/home.
